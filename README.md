# Springboard-Capstone-2
This repository will contain all of the files for the second capstone project assigned in the Springboard Data Science Career Track program.

This capstone project involved predicting water pump status using data collected from the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, which has been organized into datasets by DrivenData.  These datasets were made available by DrivenData for a Kaggle competition and on their website, where they host competitions with humanitarian impact. 

Each phase of the data science life cycle has been organized into a Jupyter notebook, with supporting code included in custom .py scripts.

Phase 1: C2 Data Wrangling.ipynb

Phase 2: C2 Data Story.ipynb

Phase 3: C2 Statistical Data Analysis.ipynb

Phase 4: C2 Machine Learning (coming soon)

A summary of the first 3 phases is included in the Milestone Report 1.

A summary of the machine learning phase and final findings wil be included in the Milestone Report 2 (coming soon).
