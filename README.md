# Springboard-Capstone-2
This repository contains all of the files for the second capstone project assigned in the Springboard Data Science Career Track program.

This capstone project involved predicting water pump status using data collected from the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, which has been organized into datasets by DrivenData.  These datasets were made available by DrivenData for a Kaggle competition and on their website, where they host competitions with humanitarian impact. 

Each phase of the data science life cycle has been organized into a Jupyter notebook, with supporting code included in custom .py scripts, and Pandas Profiling reports available in html files.

Phase 1: C2 Data Wrangling.ipynb

Phase 2: C2 Data Story.ipynb

Phase 3: C2 Statistical Data Analysis.ipynb

Phase 4: C2 Machine Learning.ipynb and C2 Analyze ML Results.ipynb


Project Reports:

A summary of the first 3 phases is included in the Milestone Report 1.

A summary of the machine learning phase and final findings is included in the Milestone Report 2.

A slide deck presenting the stages of the project and findings is included in Capstone 2 Project Predicting Pump Status Slide Deck.

A summary report for the entire project is included in Capstone 2 Summary Report.


Data Files:

The raw data was downloaded from URL's provided by DrivenData, but the two main datasets used for the statistical data analysis and machine learning phases have been uploaded as low_var.csv and high_var.csv 

The evaluation metrics produced during the machine learning phase are available in C2MLResults_3.csv
